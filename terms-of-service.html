            <p class="text mt-4"><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br> Trading requires a SSN for tax purposes. We do not
                condone
                those that are under
                18 to trade without permission. Understanding the implications at hand and doing proper research is
                required. If you are underage, we recommend you wait until you are of age or to create a custodial

            <p class="text">Options Risk <br>
                Options come with risk as with any trading does. However, the amount of risk and volatility that it
                pertains to is much larger than traditional investing. Options are a great way to turn a small
                capital account into a large one, although under heavy risk. Risk management is something that you
                MUST exercise in order to be successful while trading.</p>
            <!--  -->
            <p class="text">Options trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be
                aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in the options markets. Do NOT
                trade with money you can’t afford to lose. This is neither a solicitation nor an offer to Buy/Sell
                options. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or
